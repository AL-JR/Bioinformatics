INTRODUCTION
============
This directory contains files for the Genomics Education Partnership
(GEP) Drosophila annotation projects. The goal of this project is to
produce high quality annotations for the Muller F element of
different Drosophila species via a student-scientist partnership. To
learn more about the partnership, please visit us at
http://gep.wustl.edu.

This package contains some of the analyses that have been run on each
contig sequence.  Additional analysis results are available at the
GEP UCSC Genome Browser mirror at http://gander.wustl.edu.


PACKAGE ORGANIZATION
====================
Each package contains a number of files that you might find useful:

Contents of Package Root Directory
----------------------------------
Note: # corresponds to the contig number assigned to the project

  src = contains the nucleotide sequence of the contig

  analysis = results of analyses for each contig

  Contents of the 'src' Directory:
    - contig#.fasta
      Nucleotide sequence of contig

    - contig#.fasta.masked
      Contig sequence with repeats masked as N's

    - contig#.fasta.trf =
      Contig sequence with tandem repeats masked as N's

  Contents of the 'analysis' Directory:
    - BLASTresults
      blastx results searching the contig against the
      D. melanogaster protein translation database

    - Genefinder
      Results from various gene finders

    - Repeats
      RepeatMasker analysis of the contig using a custom Drosophila
      repeat library

  README:
    Describe the organization of each annotation package (this file)

  projectReport_<region>_<release>_<projectname>.doc:
    Annotation report that the annotator will submit to the GEP


Additional BLAST Search Details
-------------------------------
  After masking species-specific repeats, blastx searches were run using
    BLASTX 2.0MP-WashU [04-May-2006]

  with the following parameters:
    -B=1000000 -V=1000000 -hspmax=0 -matrix=PAM120 -Q=12 -R=4
    -hspsepQmax=4500 -topComboN=1 -links -e=1e-10


Contents of Genefinder Directory
--------------------------------
This directory contains the results from various gene predictors

  - contig#.fasta.masked.<gene predictor>
    Output from the <gene predictor>

  -- contig#.<gene predictor>.pep
    Tab delimited file listing the name of predicted gene and corresponding
    predicted peptide sequence

Gene prediction results from the following gene finders are also
available on the GEP UCSC Genome Browser Mirror:

  Genscan, Twinscan, Geneid, SGP2, Augustus, SNAP, GlimmerHMM


Contents of Repeats Directory
-----------------------------
This directory contains the results of the RepeatMasker analysis.

  - contig#.fasta.masked
    Nucleotide sequence of the contig with repeats masked with N's

  - contig#.fasta.out
    List of repeats and their locations identified in this contig

  - contig#.fasta.tbl
    Summary table of all repeats identified in this contig
